        <p>IHow good digital asset management (DAM) can help you to scale your content marketing </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <article>
            <p>The last few years have seen companies focus an increasing amount of time and resources on content marketing. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2022/12/23/digital-marketing-in-2023-what-to-expect-and-how-to-excel/?sh=11b207824858">2023 promises to be no different</a>, but in their attempts to scale their content marketing strategy, organizations often overlook several issues and pain-points that can hold them back.</p>
            <p>One commonly under appreciated concern is the role that your digital asset management (DAM) can play in your ability to scale your content. Affecting everything from time-to-market to consistent on-brand messaging, the right digital asset management processes can completely change the effectiveness of your content marketing strategy.</p>
            <p>So, let’s take a closer look at how digital asset management can impact your marketing workflow and how the right DAM solution can help you to scale your content marketing.</p>
            <h3>How your digital asset management is impacting your marketing performance</h3>
            <p>Stop us if this sounds familiar, but many organizations lack a consistent approach to how they store and share their digital assets. They might be using a basic hosting service (like Dropbox or Google Drive) to store their assets, another provider (like Figma or Adobe) to edit their images, and another service (often email) to share their assets.</p>
            <p>Not only can using multiple service providers make it more difficult to create efficient workflows and enable collaboration, but many of those services were not even intended for the ways in which they’re being used — that’s right, your email service provider didn’t expect to be used as a collaborative marketing tool and asset library.</p>
            <p>And this approach leads to some issues that can drastically limit your ability to scale your content marketing.</p>
            <p><strong>Difficulty handling a growing volume of assets</strong></p>
            <p>It goes without saying that scaling your content marketing strategy will require you to handle an increasing number of digital assets. But if your workflow and tools aren’t build to scale, then your strategy can’t either.</p>
            <p>Your first concern will be cost, as many hosting platforms will charge you more as you use them more, but that’s only the start of the problem. Using multiple software providers can lead to complicated workflows and difficulties finding the right assets to use.</p>
            <p>Most of us will have experienced the frustration of attempting to search through a library only to end up empty handed — often opting to re-upload an asset over wasting time searching for it. Wasted time and inefficiency reduces collaboration, kills engagement, and is one of the biggest obstacles to scaling a content marketing strategy.</p>
            <p><strong>Managing an omnichannel approach</strong> </p>
            <p>Creating content for a single channel is difficult enough, but scaling content across multiple channels will expose any pain points and inefficiencies in your workflows. From website content, to emails, to social media, developing bespoke media assets for each channel and audience is crucial — meaning that you need the right tools to create, store, and edit those assets.</p>
            <p>An omnichannel approach will often require collaboration across multiple teams, and if those teams are using different tools and solutions then there can often be a breakdown in communication and collaboration.</p>
            <p><strong>Delivering tailored content</strong></p>
            <p>One of common desired outcomes from a scaled content strategy is a more personalized marketing experience with a greater number of touch points. Once again, this requires more digital assets, more collaboration, and puts more strain on your marketing workflows.</p>
            <p>If you’re relying on an outdated approach to digital asset management then there’s a good chance that you will struggle to create the custom assets that you need, find them when you need them, and share them in the right places.</p>
            <p><strong>Return on investment</strong></p>
            <p>We’re all feeling the squeeze in 2023, and your marketing budget is no different. So why pay for multiple software providers when you could find a single platform that does all of the jobs in one? Not only will this improve your workflows and efficiency, but it could significantly reduce your spend on your marketing tech stack and increase the return on investment on all of your new marketing campaigns.</p>
            <h3>The benefits of choosing the right DAM</h3>
            <p>You may not have put much thought into how your approach to digital asset management can impact your ability to scale your marketing strategy, but if you’ve made it this far then you can probably relate to some (if not all) of the pain points listed above.</p>
            <p>The good news? The solution is pretty simple. Adopting the right DAM provides you with a single source of truth that makes launching new campaigns significantly faster and easier. With the right DAM provider, you can increase productivity through several key areas.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easily find assets. The ability to easily search through your library to find the right assets helps you to launch campaigns more efficiently</li>
                <li>Reuse assets. Improved search functions and better data hygiene also increase the likelihood that you will reuse previously created assets on future campaigns</li>
                <li>Improved editing. Some DAM providers (like <a href="https://raster.app/home">Raster</a>) offer built-in editing tools that mean that you can more quickly and easily edit assets for new campaigns and channels.</li>
                <li>Better collaboration. Having all of your teams use a single tool that has been built for their specific requirements significantly increases cross-team collaboration.</li>
                <li>Improved user experience. Choosing the wrong tools for the job can impact user experience and reduce adoption rates and return on investment (ROI).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With the right DAM, your design and marketing teams will be able to work together more efficiently and launch new marketing campaigns faster than ever before. We know why organizations often overlook their DAM provider. It’s not an exciting part of your tech stack, but it does play a crucial role in your marketing workflow.	</p>
            <h3>The Raster solution</h3>
            <p>Solving all of these problems on a single platform is no mean feat, but the team at <a href="https://monogram.io/">Monogram</a> developed Raster because of their frustrations with the existing DAM solutions and the problems that we’ve outlined throughout this article. Their familiarity with the various pain points and use cases meant that they could see how a good DAM could impact the entire marketing workflow.</p>
            <p>So, that’s what Raster aims to do. It’s more than just a DAM, it improves every aspect of your marketing workflow. By allowing you to store, edit, and share your digital assets on a single platform you’re able to improve collaboration across designers, developers, and marketers, increase your time-to-market, and ensure brand consistency. </p>
            <p>Raster truly is the all-in-one platform for digital asset management, delivering: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unlimited storage</li>
                <li>AI tagging and search functions</li>
                <li>Built-in image editing</li>
                <li>Image optimization</li>
                <li>Best-in-class security</li>
                <li>and more..</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Raster has also been developed to deliver an unrivalled user experience. Managing digital assets across hosting platforms and email providers is clumsy and unrewarding. Raster ensures that you get the type of user experience you’ve come to expect from industry leaders across other areas of your tech stack.</p>
